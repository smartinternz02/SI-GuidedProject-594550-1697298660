Overview
Welcome to the AI-Enabled Car Parking System project! This project leverages the power of OpenCV to implement an intelligent car parking system. The system uses computer vision techniques to detect and analyze parking spaces, helping drivers find available spots efficiently.

Features
Parking Spot Detection: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time parking spot detection through image processing.

Occupancy Status: Determines whether a parking spot is occupied or vacant.

User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for drivers to visualize available parking spaces.

Easy Integration: Can be easily integrated with existing parking infrastructure and surveillance systems.
